Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
*** The Project Three submission was difficult for me. There was a lot of functions. Getting the output exactly correct took some time. 
What did you do particularly well?
*** Figuring out what the problem was in the output I am particularly well with identifying. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
*** I think I could enhance my code by utilizing the functions better, having a linked list or class that holds and access information better. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
*** The code that was difficult for me to write was the functions and how exactly they work with each other. Managing all of the functions within a program is a difficult task for me right now. I plan on getting a better understanding of functions and how they work together by online practice websites, reading info pages, and suggestions from others in the field. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
*** I think all the problem solving and critical thinking will apply to all other projects. I think it's important to apply what you learn wherever you can in any part of life where that situation comes up to use it. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
*** I made this program maintainable by writing clear code using best standards and practices to the best of my knowledge, readable by using appropriate variable names, and adaptable by not hard coding or limiting information making the code more universal.
